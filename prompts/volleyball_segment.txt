Analyze this video clip of a volleyball broadcast.

Determine:
1. Is a live rally in progress?
   - true: The ball is actively in play in LIVE footage — from the moment the server contacts the ball until the point ends (ball lands, goes out, or a fault occurs)
   - false:
     - Replays or slow-motion playback (even if showing rally action — look for slow motion, "REPLAY" overlays, or repeated footage)
     - Serve preparation (player bouncing ball, tossing but not yet contacting)
     - Celebrations, reactions after a point ends
     - Timeouts, substitutions, walking between points
     - Interviews, ads, or other non-gameplay content
     - Player close-up

2. What is the camera shot type?
   - "full_court": Fixed high-angle camera showing the entire court with both teams visible and the camera not moving — the standard live gameplay broadcast view
   - "close_up": Any other shot — player close-ups, replays, celebrations, interviews, partial court views, or any shot where the camera is panning, zooming, or tracking a player

Respond in this exact JSON format:
